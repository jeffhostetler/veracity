Turning this zip file into a working Veracity installation takes just three steps:

1. Extract it somewhere, like C:\veracity.

2. Add that directory to your PATH environment variable.

3. Run this command to enable the scrum module and the server:

     vv config set server/files C:\veracity\server_files

(but use the path where you unzipped it, not C:\veracity)

We also recommend installing SourceGear Diffmerge.

DiffMerge is a free, graphical application for file diffs and 
merges. Veracity integration works nicely, out of the box. 
Particularly if you don't have an alternate favorite tool, we
highly recommend installing it. You can download a zip archive
or an installer here:
