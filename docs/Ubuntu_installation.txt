# Using SourceGear's Apt Repository
When installing on an Ubuntu system you can choose to install either the *stable*
or *nightly* builds of Veracity.

The *stable* build is the latest official release of Veracity.  This is the 
version that is recommended for production use.

The *nightly* build is the latest pre-release version of Veracity.  Builds from 
this repository are generated from a snapshot of the code currently in 
development, and thus may contain bugs.
 
## Stable
To add the SourceGear stable repository to your system add a file named 
sourcegear.list to you systems /etc/apt/sources.list.d directory with the 
following contents:

    deb http://debian.sourcegear.com/ubuntu <ubuntu_release> main
    deb-src http://debian.sourcegear.com/ubuntu <ubuntu_release>  main

Replace <ubuntu_release> with the name of your installed ubuntu release\*.

## Nightlies

To add the SourceGear nightly repository to your system add a file named 
sourcegear.list to you systems /etc/apt/sources.list.d directory with the 
following contents:

    deb http://debian.sourcegear.com/ubuntu <ubuntu_release> nightly
    deb-src http://debian.sourcegear.com/ubuntu <ubuntu_release>  nightly

Replace <ubuntu_release> with the name of your installed ubuntu release\*. 


\* You can get this name from the output of this command `lsb_release -c`

## Adding SourceGear's PGP key to APT

Packages in the SourceGear APT repository are cryptographically signed using a 
PGP key to ensure their integrity.  In order to verify the packages contents, 
you will first need to add SourceGears public key to APT.  This can be done by 
executing the following command at a command prompt:

    sudo wget -O - http://debian.sourcegear.com/SOURCEGEAR-GPG-KEY | sudo apt-key add -

## Installing Veracity

After adding a new APT repository and installing the PGP key, you will need to 
run the following command to update your APT sources:

    sudo apt-get update

Next you can install the veracity package:

    sudo apt-get install veracity
