# I've built Veracity, now what?

You've had a succesful build, the `vv` command is in your path,
and you'd like to actually *do* something.  Let's get you 
started with a local repository, then see what it takes to
push, pull and merge with others.

## Creating a repository

Choose your favorite projects folder, or temp, or whatever. Let's
say you've chosen `~/projects`. Now create a `vvtest` working copy
under that:

    cd ~/projects
    mkdir vvtest
    cd vvtest
    vv init vvtestrepo
    
Two things happened: a `vvtestrepo` repository was created, and
your current directory (`~/projects/vvtest`) became a working
copy of that repository. The repository, and the folder, are empty
right now.

## Who am I?

We should tell Veracity who you are. Run

    vv whoami --create myemail@example.com

The --create flag will try to create the user first, so you will 
only need to use that flag the first time you run whoami.
    
## Adding some stuff

Let's give Veracity something to do.  Create a file:

    echo Hello, world > file.txt
    
Then say

    vv status
    
and you should see

    Found: @/file.txt
    
"Found" means Veracity sees a file it doesn't yet know about. "@/" is the
root of the repository.  To tell Veracity to keep track of this file:

    vv add file.txt
    
`vv status` will now say:

    Added: @/file.txt
    
Let's commit that to the repository, so we can play with it a bit.

    vv commit -m"I added a file"
    
Where `-m="..."` is the comment that will be associated with this checkin.

Things we can now do:

    vv rename file.txt somethingelse.txt
    vv move file.txt someotherdir/
    vv remove file.txt
    
All of which must be followed by a `vv commit` to be recorded.  Prior to 
that, `vv revert` can undo your changes.

If you change the file on disk, e.g.

    echo Another line >> file.txt
    
`vv status` will list it as "Modified".  You can see the changes by saying
`vv diff file.txt` for one file, or just `vv diff` to see all uncommitted
file changes.

## Running the server

So far, this is all local.  To share your code and changes with others,
you'll need to run a server, or connect to someone else's. For now, 
you'll be the server.

The first thing you'll need to do is tell Veracity where to find its
collateral files (stylesheets, javascript, HTML templates, etc.) 

If you unpacked the source according to the BUILD documentation, your
collateral files live in `~/v/veracity/src/server_files.

Let's say your home directory (~) is really `/home/someguy`. You'll want to
do the following:

    vv localsettings set server/files /home/someguy/v/veracity/src/server_files
    
Now, still in your `vvtest` directory, run:

    vv serve
    
Veracity's internal web server is up and running on Port 8080. Open a browser
(not IE, just yet, but Chrome, Safari, Firefox should work nicely) and
you can see your history, add work items, and so on. 

## Playing with Others

What you can *also* do is push and pull code through this server.

Assuming the machine you've been using is `vvhost`, move over to `vvclient`.

On the client, to get a working copy of that same code:

    cd ~/projects/
    vv clone http://vvhost:8080/repos/vvtestrepo
    vv checkout vvtestrepo vvtest
    cd vvtest
   
And you're in a working copy of a clone of the original repo.

Make your own local changes, commit them, then:

    vv push
   
to send them back to the host. If you see an error complaining that
this would create multiple heads, that means there are changes on the 
host side that you haven't pulled yet.  Get those, merge them locally,
*then* push.    Actually, it's a better idea to *always* pull, merge,
run unit tests, and commit the merge before pushing.

    vv pull
    vv merge
    # test, test, test
    vv commit -m"merged changes from host"
    vv push
