# Building SourceGear Veracity under Mac OS

## Introduction

Assumed - you are running Mac OS Snow Leopard (10.6), Lion (10.7),
or Mountain Lion (10.8) and are comfortable at a `terminal` prompt.


## Getting/Unpacking the Source

There are two options.

 - Download the latest [Veracity tarball][1].

or

 - Clone the public repository:
    `vv clone http://public.veracity-scm.com/repos/veracity veracity`
    (Note that you won't be able to push to this repository.)

Unpack or checkout in the directory of your choice - for brevity, we'll pretend
you unpacked it under `~/v`, and so your source tree begins at `~/v/veracity`


## Prerequisites

### XCode Toolkit

If you don't already have XCode 3.2 (or higher) installed, you can find it on 
your Snow Leopard install DVD.

If you don't have a Snow Leopard install DVD, you can download Xcode from the
Apple Developer web site.

If you decide to download Xcode, you'll need to register as an Apple Developer.
It's free. It's quick. 


### XCode 4.2 and earlier

Having done that, visit the [Downloads for Apple Developers][2] page, and
download XCode 4.2.1.

Install as instructed.


### XCode 4.3 and later

As of version 4.3, XCode is now a Mac App Store application, and installation
is a bit different.

You'll need to do the following to build Veracity with XCode 4.3 through 4.5:

1. Install XCode from the Mac App Store
2. Install the Auxiliary tools from the [Developer Downloads][2] page.  The
    download is a disk image.  Open it, and copy the contents to
    `/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Applications/`
2. Install the Command-Line Tools from Xcode's
    `Preferences / Downloads / Components` tab.
3. Make sure xcode-select points to the the 4.x App Root - typically by running
    `sudo xcode-select -switch /Applications/Xcode.app/`
4. If you've built previous Veracity versions, or build with older Xcode
    versions in the past, delete the "CMakeCache.txt" file in your build
    directory, then re-run CMake.

Note that CMake 2.8.8 or later is required to build with XCode 4.3 or later.


### CMake

Install [CMake][3].

Download the [Mac installer][4], and install as instructed.


### vv-thirdparty

During the build process, some third party libraries will be built.  In order for
this libraries to be found and linked by the build process you will need to
set an enviroment variable.  This path will differ depending on the bitness
of your machine.  To determine if your machine is 64 bit, run the following
command:

	sysctl -n hw.cpu64bit_capable

If this command returns `1` your machine can run 64-bit executables.  Edit
`~/.profile` and add the following line for 64-bit executables:

	export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=~/v/vv-thirdparty/universal/lib:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH

OR (for 32-bit)

	export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=~/v/vv-thirdparty/i386/lib:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH

You should open a new terminal window to ensure this is in effect before
building/running Veracity.


## Creating the Build Directory and Building Veracity

`cmake` will handle the creation of Makefiles, etc. You just need to give it a
place to work.

For example, let's create a `~/v/debug`, a neighbor of our source directory.

cd to this folder, then run:

    cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" ../veracity
    
You now have a build tree, replete with Makefiles.  You'll only need to run the
top-level one. So:

    cd ~/v/debug
    make


## Updating your PATH to find Veracity Command Line Tools

To make your life easier at this point, you'll want to add the following to
your PATH:

    ~/v/debug/src/cmd
    ~/v/debug/src/script
    
the homes of `vv` (the Veracity command-line app) and `vscript` (the scripting
engine), respectively.


## Running the Test Suite

To run the test suite:

    cd ~/v/debug
    make test
    
All tests should pass. If there are failures, you can [consult the logs][5].
