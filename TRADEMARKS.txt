Version 2.0, but this license explicitly (in section 6) does not
give you permission to use our trademarks.

"SourceGear" and "Veracity" are trademarks of SourceGear.
Except as indicated here, you may not use these marks, or any
other terms or symbols which are confusingly similar, without
written permission from SourceGear.

1.  If you are redistributing unmodified files distributed by
SourceGear, and you are doing so in compliance with the relevant
copyright license, then you may use our marks to identify
those files.  For example, under the terms of the Apache License
version 2.0 you may redistribute the Veracity source code,
and if you are distributing it just as you received it from
us, without changes, you may call it Veracity.

2.  You may use our marks when you are writing or speaking
about the Veracity software.  For example, if you are writing
a book or an article, you need not ask our permission to refer to
our software by its name.  This applies whether your opinions
of Veracity are positive or negative.  We request that you clearly
identify that "SourceGear" and "Veracity" are trademarks of 
SourceGear wherever you normally acknowledge important trademarks
in your work.

3.  For any other situation, except for cases of "nominative fair use",
you need written permission from SourceGear to use our marks (or other
terms or symbols which are confusingly similar).  Examples include:

  using some or all of the Veracity source code in another kind
  of product

  incorporating some or all of the Veracity source code into
  another version control or ALM system

  derivative works

  a fork of the project

  on merchandise

  in domain names

  any situation where there is likelihood of confusion about whether
  SourceGear is involved with or is endorsing your efforts

4.  Nothing here shall be interpreted to allow any third party to claim any
association with SourceGear or to imply any approval or support by SourceGear
for any third party products or services.
