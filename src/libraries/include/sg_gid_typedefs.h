/**
 * A GID is a Generated ID.  Similar to a traditional UUID or GUID,
 * it is a unique, generated, random value (and not a hash).
 *
 * A GID is used to UNIQUELY IDENTIFY an OBJECT over time.  We expect
 * this to be a permanent, long-term, global (in the "planetary" sense)
 * association.  For example, when a file is first added to a repository,
 * it is assigned a permanent GID which can be used to find the file no
 * matter how it is moved and/or renamed over time.
 *
 * A GID is VERY LONG (64 lowercase hex digit) string.  It is constructed
 * in such a way that we should never get a collision (both within a
 * computer over time and across all computers on the project).  To
 * distinguish a GID from other types of IDs, a GID starts with a 'g'.
 *
 * A GID is just a "const char *".  We DO NOT wrap this in a complicated
 * typedef because we use GIDs as keys in RBTREEs and VHASHes and in
 * callbacks and etc.  Tis better to just be honest here.
 *
 * SG_GID_ACTUAL_LENGTH is the length of the actual ID string -- NOT
 *                      COUNTING the trailing NULL.
 *
 * SG_GID_BUFFER_LENGTH is the length for a proper stack buffer AND
 *                      INCLUDES the trailing NULL.
