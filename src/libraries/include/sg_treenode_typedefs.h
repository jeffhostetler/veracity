/**
 * @file sg_treenode_typedefs.h
 *
 * @details A Treenode is a representation of a single directory under version
 * control.  That is, a list of files, sub-directories, and etc. in a directory
 * as of a particular version.  This is a versioned list.  It contains information
 * for everything in the directory: the version of each file/sub-directory, their
 * names, permissions, and etc.  All of this information is serialized in a JSON
 * stream and that is stored in a Treenode-type Blob.  The JSON stream is stored
 * as the Blob Content.  The Blob HID (computed on the JSON stream) is called the
 * Treenode Hash Identifier (HID).  As with all Blobs, this HID uniquely identifies
 * the Treenode and is the only handle to lookup/access the Treenode content.
 *
 * A Treenode contains a list/array of Treenode-Entry where each Treenode-Entry
 * represents a single file/sub-directory/etc in the directory.
 *
 * Since the Treenode contains complete information for each directory-entry under
 * version control and the HID is computed over all of it, a COMMIT that makes a
 * change to any directory-entry (i.e., a change to a file, a rename to a
 * file/sub-directory, a mode-bit change, etc) will require a new Treenode HID to be
 * created.  This will cause a bubble-up effect as the Treenode HID is updated in
 * the Treenodes of containing directories.
 *
 * A COMMIT that makes a change to a directory-entry causes a new Treenode-Entry
 * to be created in a new version of the Treenode.  This new Treenode-Entry is
 * populated with fields defined by the current software reversion.  Treenode-Entries
 * for unchanged entries are carried forward as is from the previous Treenode.
 *
 * We have a Treenode-Version field on the entire Treenode and a separate
 * Treenode-Entry-Version field on each Treenode-Entry in the Treenode.
 *
 * The actual in-memory format of the Treenode is opaque, but there are routines to
 * access all the necessary fields.
