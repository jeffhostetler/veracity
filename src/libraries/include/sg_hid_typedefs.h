/**
 * A HID is a Hash ID.  This value is the result of a hash computation
 * using an algorithm like SHA-256 or MD5.
 *
 * When a REPO is created we allow a Hash Algorithm to be chosen for that REPO.
 * THAT ALGORITHM AND ONLY THAT ALGORITHM WILL BE USED; that value cannot be
 * changed and it is inherited by all REPO instances.  The REPO internally
 * stores the chosen algorithm.
 *
 * THEREFORE, a HID DOES NOT have a COMPILE-TIME FIXED-LENGTH; the length
 * depends upon the algorithm.  We define a MAXIMUM HID length as a guideline
 * so that code can use stack buffers when convenient; this is an upperbound
 * and will waste some space.
 *
 * WE DO NOT include an algorithm id in the HID because ALL HIDs within a
 * REPO will have been computed using the same algorithm.  And since HIDs
 * are frequently seen by the user (a changeset is named by its HID), we
 * don't want to force them to type a 'h' prefix or have to worry about
 * stripping out such prefixes when we display a history or have to worry
 * about whether they should or should not appear in any JSON that we
 * hand up.
 *
 * WE ALWAYS store/fetch/parse/print/use a HID as a lowercase hex character
 * string of n digits; that is, we NEVER try to pass this around as binary
 * value.
 *
 * So, in memory a HID is a simple "const char *" consisting of the
 * lowercase hex digits.  We DO NOT wrap this in a compilcated typedef
 * because we use HIDs as keys in RBTREEs and VHASHes and in callbacks
 * and etc.  Tis better to just be honest here.
 *
 * If we assume at some point in the near future that we'll have 512 bit
 * hashes, that gives us 128 hex digits (bytes).
