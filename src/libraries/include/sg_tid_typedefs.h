/**
 * A TID is a Temporary ID.  Similar to one of our GIDs and also
 * similar to a traditional UUID or GUID, it is a unique, generated,
 * random value (probably not a hash).
 *
 * TIDs are weaker than GIDs.  They are intended to be used when we
 * need a unique name/id for some short-term operation.  For example,
 * to name a temporary directory or file or a table column for the
 * duration of an operation.  We need them to be unique for a short
 * period of time on the current system -- rather than absolutely
 * unique for all time and all systems.
 *
 * We reserve the right to just create a GID and lop off some of the
 * trailing digits.
 *
 * There are times when our GIDs are just too long.  For example, if
 * we create a temp file nested inside a couple of temp directories,
 * we could easily have a 200 character pathname which can cause
 * problems if your $TEMP directory is deeply nested to begin with or
 * if you are building very long command lines and etc.
 * Or, for example, limits on the length of table and column names
 * in various SQL databases cause us problems if we try to use a GID
 * or HID as a table or column name.
 *
 * To distinguish a TID from a GID or HID, a TID starts with a 't'.
 *
 * We optionally allow the length of the random part to be specified
 * and/or for you to truncate a TID by stuffing a zero byte somewhere
 * inside the buffer; so we only define a MAXIMUM buffer size required
 * to hold a TID and we do not define an EXPECTED/ACTUAL length.
 * (And any verification routine can only check for the initial 't'
 * followed by some number of hex digits, but it cannot verify any
 * length constraint.)
 *
 * By default, a TID has the same length as a GID.
