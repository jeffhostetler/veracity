/**
 * @file sg_dagfrag_prototypes.h
 *
 * @details Routines for manipulating a fragment of the dag.
 *
 * A DAGFRAG is a subset of the entire DAG.  It contains a
 * set of dagnodes that can be in one of three states:
 * QS_START_MEMBER -- a member of the fragment and a starting point.
 * QS_INTERIOR_MEMBER -- a member of the fragment, but not a starting point.
 * QS_END_FRINGE -- not a member of the fragment, but the immediate
 *                  parent of a member (of either type).
 *
 * We can use this to express a portion of the graph during
 * PUSH/PULL operations, for example.  Where we want to transmit
 * graph connectivity with a minimum number of round-trips.
 *
 * The START_MEMBERs gives the various starting points in the
 * graph included in this fragment -- this is usually the complete
 * set of LEAVES, but there is no reason to limit it to that.
 * In reality, it can be any collection of nodes that we want to
 * start with.  Think of this as the child-most-fringe and
 * included in the fragment.
 *
 * For each starting point, we add all of the ancestor dagnodes
 * for a given number of GENERATIONS.
 *
 * The END_FRINGE are the set of immediate parents of fragment
 * members that were too old (generation-wise).  Think of this
 * as the parent-most-fringe.
 *
 * This construction allows us, for example, to PUSH our complete
 * set of LEAVES and n GENERATIONS from one repo instance to
 * another.  If the receiving repo knows about all of the DAGNODES
 * in the END-FRINGE, then it can apply the fragment to its DAG
 * and know that it will have a completely connected graph; if
 * one of the END-FRINGE DAGNODES is unknown, it can reject the
 * fragment and request the sender send a deeper one.   It is
 * expected that most of the information in the fragment is
 * redundant (that the receiver already knows about most of the
 * DAGNODES in the fragment) and that it only needs information
 * on the most recent commits.  It will be important to tune
 * the GENERATION setting to minimize wasted bandwidth but also
 * minimize the odds of a rejection.
 *
 *
 * The graph fragment that we represent does not need to be
 * completely connected.  We could be representing 3 different
 * branches/heads/leaves and 2 generations of their ancestors,
 * so we might have 3 independent subsets of the graph in the
 * fragment.
