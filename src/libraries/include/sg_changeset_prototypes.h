/**

 * <ol>
 * <li>User-Root Treenode.  This is an artificial directory containing
 * at most one treenode-entry -- the actual root directory of the
 * user's project.  This containing directory allows us to represent
 * the name, mode bits, GID, and etc of user's actual root directory.
 *
 * This differs a little bit from Vault where the user's actual root
 * directory is known as "$" within the repository and the user creates
 * and binds a working directory to "$".
 *
 * All user files and directories under version control are entries
 * and sub-entries of the actual root directory.
 * </li>
 *
 * <li>Config-Root Treenode.  This is a TBD.  It will be a directory of
 * any version-controlled control/config files that we may need and
 * that we don't want to store in the user's working directory.
 * </li>
 * </ol>

 * Anytime a user file or sub-directory under version control is changed,
 * the containing Treenode will change; this will cause the containing
 * directory Treenode to change; and so on.  This bubble-up effect will
 * cause the User-Root Treenode to change.  So we expect a unique
 * User-Root Treenode for each Changeset where there are changes to files
 * or directories under version control,  If there are no changes to
 * version-controlled files from parent changeset(s), the User-Root
 * Treenode should be the same.
 *
 * We keep the actual user root directory in a separate Root Treenode
 * from the Root Treenode containing the config files because we don't
 * place any restrictions on the name of the actual root directory and
 * don't want any collisions with our control files.

/**
 * The Blob List is a list of blobs that this Changeset references
 * that were not referenced by at least one of the parent Changesets.
 * The purpose of this list is to allow for efficient push/pull
 * between Repositories.  That is, a recipient of this Changeset (who
 * already has at least one of the parents) is "probably" also going to
 * need these Blobs before they can do productive work.  The goal here
 * is to minimize the chattiness and/or the number of round-trips in
 * the exchange.
 *
 * Note that "the blob list" is now actually several lists, organized
 * by type.  The "type" is the type of the reference to the blob, not the type
 * of the blob.  A given blob might be a userfile in one changeset and a
 * treenode in another.  Unlikely, but possible.
 *
 * We say "probably" because Blobs are not owned by a Changeset.  An
 * individual Blob (and therefore its Blob HID) represents all instances
 * of objects that have identical content.  So adding a reference to a
 * particular Blob to this Changeset ***does not*** necessarily imply
 * that it was freshly created for this Changeset.
 *
 * This list doesn't tell anybody what changed or how.  You have to
 * walk the Root Treenodes and DB and compare them with those of a
 * parent Changeset for that.
 *
 * TODO It is possible that this list is not the absolute minimum.
 * That is, when we have a sparse Repository, it is possible that
 * this list contains Blobs that are newly referenced in the active
 * portion of the tree but that are also referenced in the sparse
 * portion of the parents.  And they look new to this Changeset
 * because we never needed to traverse the sparse portion of the
