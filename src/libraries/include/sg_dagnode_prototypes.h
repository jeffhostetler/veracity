/**
 *
 * @file sg_dagnode_prototypes.h
 *
 * @details Routines for manipulating DAGNODES.
 *
 * A DAGNODE (in the DAG) corresponds to a CHANGESET.
 *
 * A DAGNODE only contains information about the EDGES from a
 * child CHANGESET to all of its parent CHANGESET(S).  Most
 * CHANGESETS will only have 1 parent; MERGE CHANGESETS will
 * have at least 2 - most merges will be 2-way, but we allow
 * for the possibility of more.
 *
 * A DAGNODE is stored in the REPO independent of the contents
 * of the actual CHANGESET.  This allows various levels of
 * sparseness within the REPO.
 *
 * The information in a DAGNODE is used to allows REPOS
 * exchange DAG-related information without worrying about
 * the contents of the CHANGESET.  The information in a
 * DAGNODE is also stored within the CHANGESET.
 *
 * The DAGNODE's on-disk format is determined by the SQL layer
 * hiding underneath the SG_repo__ API; it is completely opaque
 * to us.  The REPO layer can use SG_dagnode__ API to build the
 * DAGNODE memory object from scratch.
 *
 * The DAGNODE memory object is used:
 * <ol>
 * <li>during the COMMIT process to capture the essense of a
 * newly-created CHANGESET blob and update the REPO's DAG.</li>
 *
 * <li>to represent a DAGNODE in memory when the application
 * needs to build (all or a portion of) the DAG in memory in
 * order to perform various history queries - such as computing
 * the common ancestor of 2 nodes.  In these instances, the
 * in-memory DAGNODE object may have additional fields defined
 * that are not stored on disk and are completely ignored by
 * the SG_repo API.</li>
 * </ol>

 * in the name, or _a_.  Similarly, we want it to be quite clear when
 * we pass a pointer to a function, does the caller still own the
 * pointer or not?

 * also added a similar routine to SG_chagneset.  Since this was
 * in the middle of an already large merge, I didn't want to start
