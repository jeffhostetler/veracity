 * The DAG Least Common Ancestor (LCA) computation produces
 * a GRAPH of the "Significant" DAG Nodes.  That is, nodes
 * that are significant in the branch/merge history of the
 * overall DAG from the point of view of the given set of
 * Leaf Nodes.
 *
 * Nodes in the LCA GRAPH can be one of the following types:
 *
 * A LEAF node is one of the initial leaves that we were given.
 * It is in the result vector so that ancestors may reference
 * it by index in their bit-vectors.
 *
 * A SPCA node represents a join (when looking from the leaves
 * back towards the root).  This is a Significant (possibly Partial)
 * Common Ancestor.
 *
 * A LCA node is the final/absolute LCA of the entire set
 * of leaves.
 *
 * A NOBODY node is a non-significant dagnode. These will not
 * appear in the final results.
