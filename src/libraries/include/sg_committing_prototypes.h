 *
 * @details Routines to manage the transaction of creating a Changeset (a commit).
 *
 * When creating a Changeset you must do it within the context of a
 * CHANGESET TRANSACTION and a DAG TRANSACTION.  These are 2 independent
 * transactions that must happen in series.
 *
 * SG_committing is used to manage that process:
 *     <ul>
 *     <li>Use __alloc to allocate a SG_committing memory object and implicitly
 *         begin a CHANGESET TRANSACTION.</li>
 *     <li>Then use various __add routines to add stuff (User-files, Data Structures, and
 *         etc.) to the Repository.  The HIDs from these items will then be added to the
 *         CHANGESET being created.<li>
 *     <li>Use the various __set routines to set special properties
 *         on the CHANGESET (such as the HID of the checkin comment).</li>
 *     <li>Then use __end or __abort to complete or terminate the
 *         CHANGESET TRANSACTION;  after completing the first transaction,
 *         __end implicitly handles the DAG TRANSACTION.</li>
 *     </ul>
 *
 * The CHANGESET TRANSACTION is only concerned with the creation of BLOBS.
 * And if the Transaction is interrupted we *may* or *may not* leave some
 * unreferenced BLOBS laying around (this depends upon the storage layer)
 * and WE DO NOT CARE IF THERE ARE.
 *
 * After the CHANGESET TRANSACTION is completed, we cause the REPO's DAG to be
 * updated in an independent DAG TRANSACTION.  The CHANGESET (aka DAGNODE) is not
 * actually referencable until it has been added to the DAG.
 *
 * <b>Do not</b> use SG_changeset routines directly to create or modify a Changeset
 * or use SG_repo routines directly to add stuff to the Repository.
 * Please use SG_committing instead.
 *
 * Note that SG_committing only creates a Changset in the Repository.  It does not
 * update any NDX.
 *

/**
 * Abort the in-progress Transaction and free memory.
 *
 * This aborts the Changeset that is being constructed.  No blob will
 * be created for the Changeset and the Changeset will not appear in the
 * DAG.
 *
 * THIS IS NOT A ROLLBACK IN THE TRADITIONAL SENSE.
 *
 * Because the Repository consists of many
 * individual files and we cannot get anything resembling atomic
 * transactions in the filesystem, we cannot say that this abort will
 * undo anything that it started.  The only thing we can guarantee is
 * that we can hide a Blob in the Repository until it is completely
 * written (with a rename after it is complete).  We cannot guarantee
 * that we are the only process writing to the Repository (locks suck
 * and don't always work on remote filesystems).  Because Blobs are
 * stored under their HID -- a Blob may be shared many times -- it is
 * not the property of the Changeset being created.  When one of the
 * other routines in this file is asked to create a Blob, it tries to
 * create it -- but, because of sharing, it may already exist.  This
 * sharing may sound obscure, but it could be that someone is doing
 * the same checkin from 2 different shell windows -- we'll race to
 * create each of the Blobs in the Changeset.  Anyway, when we are
 * asked to create a Blob, we actually will try to create it and
 * silently succeed without error if it already exists.  Because of the
 * inherent races, we cannot delete the Blob during the abort, because
 * we cannot tell if a concurrent process lost the race and went on.
 * It is safe to have an unreferenced Blob; but it is *NOT* safe for us to
 * delete a Blob because we didn't complete.  (Because we can't tell if it
 * is actually unreferenced or *will be* referenced by another Chanageset
 * which is still being constructed.)  Things get a little more complicated
 * when you add Push/Pull operations between Repositories to the picture.
 *
 * The important thing here is that __abort will prevent the DAG from
 * being updated and will free the memory associated with this transaction.
