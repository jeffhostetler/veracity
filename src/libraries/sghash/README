src/libraries/sghash/README

This directory builds the SGHASH static library.  It contains
all of the various third-party/reference implementations of
the various hashing algorithms that we use.

Each of the reference implementations were modified sligthly
to fit into this library.  This most meant changing references
to header files, making all functions static, fixing some
old-style function prototypes, and commenting
out the routines that we don't use.  All in all, I have tried
to minimize our changes to the actual code.

For reference and to aid in any future diffs/merges, I have
placed a copy of the original unmodified sources in the
tree too.


SHA1/160
========

The code for SHA1 was taken from the FreeBSD source tree.
.../src/sys/crypto/sha1.[ch]


SHA2/256, SHA2/384, SHA2/512
============================

The code for SHA2 was also taken from the FreeBSD source tree.
.../src/sys/crypto/sha2/sha2.[ch]


Skein (SHA3 Candidate)
======================

The code for Skein was taken from the NIST submission CD
skein_NIST_CD_091409.zip.  See the following links for details:
http://www.skein-hash.info/downloads
http://www.skein-hash.info/sites/default/files/Skein_NIST_CD_091409.zip
For now I've chosen the Reference_Implementation to minimize configuration
and build issues during development; later we will want to use one of the
optimized versions.
